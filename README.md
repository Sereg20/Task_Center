# SAP Task Center

## Overview

This guide covers all steps you need to perform in order to connect SAP Task Center service with the following systems:

- SAP S4HANA Cloud systems
- SAP S4HANA On-Premise systems
- SAP SuccessFactors

Within such approach SAP Task Center acts as a single entry point for end users to access all their assigned approval tasks whereas SAP S4HANA Cloud, SAP S4HANA On-Premise and SAP SuccessFactors systems act as tasks providers

The guide basically consists of three main parts:

- [Connect SAP SuccessFactors and SAP Task Center](https://github.com/Sereg20/Task_Center/blob/master/SF_config/README.md)
- [Connect SAP S4HANA On-Premise and SAP Task Center](https://github.com/Sereg20/Task_Center/blob/master/S4HANA_config/README.md)
- [Connect SAP S4HANA Cloud and SAP Task Center](https://github.com/Sereg20/Task_Center/blob/master/S4HANA_Cloud_config/README.md)

Also, these parts require:

- [Identity Authentication Service (IAS) Configuration](https://github.com/Sereg20/Task_Center/blob/master/IAS_config/README.md) 
- [SAP BTP Configuration](https://github.com/Sereg20/Task_Center/blob/master/BTP_config/README.md)
